# LeetCode Interview Preparation – C++ Solutions

This folder contains important LeetCode problems that I have practiced for technical interviews.

I created this collection to improve my problem solving skills, understand common patterns, and revise concepts before interviews.

All solutions are written in C++ and each problem has its own README with explanation and approach.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Purpose of This Folder

- To keep my interview preparation organized
- To revise problems quickly
- To improve logical thinking
- To track my learning progress

This is a personal learning repository and will be updated regularly.

------------------------------------------------------------

## What You Will Find Here

Each problem folder contains:

- README.md  
  (Problem explanation, approach, and key points)

- solution.cpp  
  (Clean and readable C++ code)

------------------------------------------------------------

## Topics Covered

- Arrays and Strings
- Two Pointers and Sliding Window
- Stack and Queue
- Linked List
- Binary Search
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy
- Heap

------------------------------------------------------------

## How I Practice

1. Read the problem carefully.
2. Try to solve it on my own.
3. Understand the optimal approach.
4. Write clean code.
5. Review mistakes.
6. Improve step by step.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Note

The main focus of this folder is learning and consistency, not just collecting solutions.

I try to understand every problem before moving to the next one.
